When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
--> When I want to share my code with other people....
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
--> Because you may have changes that you do not want to be published
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
--> Fork: When I make a copy of a repository inside github; Clone: When I make a copy of a remote repository; Branch: When I redesign the project locally
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
--> It is possible to compare the latest modifications in the remote and decide on what to insert in the local code
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
--> It would be practically impossible to collaborate several people without using git or github
